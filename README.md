# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

In the lectures, we covered that insertion sort has best-case time complexity of
$\Theta(n)$ and worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$. What is the
average-case time complexity ($\Theta$)?

Hint: Think about what happens in each iteration of the loop, and how often the
loop is executed. Keep in mind that for asymptotic analysis we don't care about
constant factors.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is
most important -- you can easily find the answer, but you need to demonstrate
that you've understood the concept. Add your answer to this markdown file.

# Answer 
I believe that the Average Time Complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$. My reasoning for this is based off of observing the best and worst cases of insertion sort
we were given in lecture. The best case, which is $\Theta(n)$, is when the program is run and goes through a single time, finding an already sorted list.
In contrast the worst case is when the list is sorted in reverse order, which looks like $\Theta(n^2)$. Thinking about this, the average case would 
have to be $\Theta(n^2)$, because in every other instance other than the already sorted list, the algorith has to run through both the outer loop which is
just $n$, and the inner loop which is $\frac{n}{2}$
